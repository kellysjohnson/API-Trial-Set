#### API-Trial-Set

###### Application for identification of birds based on sound and/or image.  Will include a input test field and testing to identify whether the user correctly identify the bird based on image, or sound, depending on which mode the user has selected.

###### Bird will be selected randomly and displayed to the viewer.  Points will be awarded and level achieved.  At each level items will be given to the user in a pre-determined methodology for achieving a cool, interactive, and unique result.  Verison one will include points awarded.  Will not include level ups and items given to the user.
